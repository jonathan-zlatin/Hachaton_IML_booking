# Agoda Cancellation Prediction Program

This repository contains the source code for predicting hotel booking cancellations and estimating the cost of cancellation for Agoda, an online travel agency. The program uses Python and various libraries for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The project aims to develop models to assist Agoda in predicting hotel booking cancellations and estimating the associated costs. The goals are:

1. **Cancellation Prediction**: Develop a model to predict cancellations based on booking details, customer information, and hotel characteristics.
2. **Cost Estimation**: Estimate the potential cost of cancellations to aid in decision-making regarding pricing and refund policies.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Provide insights to improve Agoda's operational efficiency by understanding cancellation patterns and cost implications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- plotly

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Ensure the necessary CSV files (`agoda_cancellation_train.csv`, `Agoda_Test_1.csv`, `Agoda_Test_2.csv`) are in the same directory.
3. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py Agoda_Test_1.csv Agoda_Test_2.csv
```

Replace `Agoda_Test_1.csv` and `Agoda_Test_2.csv` with your test data paths.

## Description

### Files

- `main.py`: Main script.
- `hackathon_code/`: Contains modules for task execution.
    - `task_1.py`: Predicts cancellations.
    - `task_2.py`: Estimates cancellation costs.
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions.
    - `ModelBaseline.py`: Baseline model implementation.

### Task Execution

1. **Task 1: Predicting Cancellations**
    - Trains a decision tree classifier.
    - Saves predictions to `agoda_cancellation_prediction.csv`.

2. **Task 2: Estimating Cost of Cancellation**
    - Trains a Ridge regression model.
    - Saves cost estimates to `agoda_cost_of_cancellation.csv`.
