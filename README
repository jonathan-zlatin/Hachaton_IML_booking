# Agoda Cancellation Prediction Program

This repository contains the source code for predicting hotel booking cancellations and estimating 
the cost of cancellation for Agoda, a leading online travel agency. The program utilizes Python 
and various libraries for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models to assist Agoda in optimizing their
operations related to hotel booking cancellations. Hotel booking cancellations can significantly impact
revenue and operational efficiency for travel agencies. By accurately predicting cancellations and 
estimating the potential cost associated with them, Agoda can implement proactive measures to mitigate
their effects and enhance customer satisfaction.

Through the utilization of machine learning techniques and data analysis, this project aims to
achieve the following goals:

1. **Cancellation Prediction**: Develop a model capable of accurately predicting hotel booking 
cancellations based on various features such as booking details, customer information, and hotel
characteristics. This model can help Agoda anticipate cancellations in advance, allowing them to 
manage inventory effectively and optimize resource allocation.

2. **Cost Estimation**: Estimate the potential cost incurred by hotel booking cancellations, 
enabling Agoda to assess the financial impact and make informed decisions regarding pricing 
strategies, refund policies, and revenue management.

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Improve the overall operational efficiency of Agoda by providing
insights into factors influencing cancellations and cost implications. By understanding the underlying 
patterns and trends, Agoda can implement targeted strategies to minimize cancellations and maximize revenue.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- plotly

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Ensure you have the necessary CSV files (`agoda_cancellation_train.csv`, `Agoda_Test_1.csv`, `Agoda_Test_2.csv`) in the same directory.
3. Run the program using Python:

```bash
python main.py Agoda_Test_1.csv Agoda_Test_2.csv
```

Replace `Agoda_Test_1.csv` and `Agoda_Test_2.csv` with the paths to your test data CSV files.

## Description

### Files

- `main.py`: Main script for executing the program.
- `hackathon_code/`: Directory containing Python modules for task execution.
    - `task_1.py`: Module for predicting hotel booking cancellations.
    - `task_2.py`: Module for estimating the cost of cancellation.
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in preprocessing.
    - `ModelBaseline.py`: Baseline model implementation.

### Task Execution

The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Task 1: Predicting Cancellations**
    - Reads the training data from `agoda_cancellation_train.csv`.
    - Trains a decision tree classifier to predict cancellations.
    - Preprocesses test data (`Agoda_Test_1.csv`).
    - Saves the cancellation predictions to `agoda_cancellation_prediction.csv`.

2. **Task 2: Estimating Cost of Cancellation**
    - Trains a Ridge regression model to estimate the cost of cancellation.
    - Preprocesses test data (`Agoda_Test_2.csv`).
    - Saves the estimated cost of cancellation to `agoda_cost_of_cancellation.csv`.

### Preprocessing

Both tasks involve preprocessing of input data, including handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical features.
